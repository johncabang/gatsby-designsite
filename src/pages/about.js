          Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship
          Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to
          seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has
          gone before. Many say exploration is part of our destiny, but itâ€™s
          actually our duty to future generations and their quest to ensure the
          survival of the human species.

          A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly
          up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't
          know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger,
          Skyler. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you
          think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!
